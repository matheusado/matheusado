<h2>Cybersecurity Projects:</h2>

- https://github.com/matheusado/appsec-vulnerability-lab
- Executed a full application security assessment on a deliberately vulnerable web app in a controlled lab environment—from reconnaissance using tools like Nmap, WhatWeb, Dirb/Gobuster, and OWASP ZAP to manual testing with Burp Suite. Discovered critical issues such as exposed admin directories, sensitive configuration disclosures via phpinfo, and hidden flags, and documented findings alongside remediation recommendations to enhance application security and resilience.
    
- https://github.com/matheusado/logon-monitor-powershell
Implemented a Windows-native auditing solution using Group Policy and PowerShell to track critical security events—successful logons (4624), failed logons (4625 & 4776), and file access (4663)—and parse them into structured HTML reports for easy review. The setup enables both manual execution and scheduled automation via Task Scheduler, giving admins real-time insight into unauthorized access attempts and user activity.
  
- https://github.com/matheusado/owasp-juice-shop-security-lab
- Conducted a full penetration test against the OWASP Juice Shop in a TryHackMe lab using tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, SQLMap, and SecLists to uncover vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, directory traversal, brute-force login, and logic bypasses. Documented each exploit with evidence and visual captures, reinforcing secure coding best practices and mastery of OWASP Top 10 risks.
  
- https://github.com/matheusado/linux-ssh-honeypot-hardening
- Deployed a hardened Linux-based SSH honeypot using Fail2ban, TCP Wrappers, Firewalld, and a decoy “bait” user to detect, log, and automatically block brute-force attacks, with bans also mirrored in /etc/hosts.deny for auditing. Delivered real-time monitoring via an Apache-served HTML dashboard and optional Splunk integration for advanced log analysis and visualization.
  
- https://github.com/matheusado/Analyzing-Web-Server-Logs-in-Splunk
-Used Splunk to aggregate and analyze web server logs—indexing access records, HTTP methods, response codes, and client IPs to identify usage trends and anomalies. Crafted SPL queries to filter, visualize, and explore log data, enabling insights into traffic patterns, potential errors, or suspicious activity.

- https://github.com/matheusado/auth0-zendesk-sso-integration
- Implemented a secure Single Sign-On (SSO) solution between Auth0 and Zendesk using SAML, enabling seamless user authentication and social login capabilities. Enhanced user experience and system security by integrating identity management with streamlined access for support agents and end users.
  
- https://github.com/matheusado/Splunk-log-analysis-lab
- Set up Splunk Enterprise on Windows 11 Pro for centralized log management, ingesting real-world datasets from GitHub. Executed targeted SPL queries to filter by specific timestamps and hosts, showcasing event-level visibility for enhanced incident analysis.
  
- https://github.com/matheusado/Configuring-Secure-Network-Segmentation-VLAN-DHCP
- Designed and implemented a secure, segmented network in Cisco Packet Tracer using DHCP for dynamic IP allocation across a 14-node network and VLAN isolation for a 6-node web server subnet. Configured inter-network routing and access controls to ensure secure communication and efficient segmentation in a realistic, hands-on environment.
  
- https://github.com/matheusadusa/Configuring-Secure-Network-Segmentation-and-VLAN-isolation-in-Packet-Tracer
- A detailed project on secure network segmentation using VLANs and static IP addressing in Cisco Packet Tracer, demonstrating isolated communication and inter-VLAN routing for enhanced security and control.

- https://github.com/matheusado/PowerShell-automation-on-administrative-tasks
- Automated essential Windows IT administrative tasks using PowerShell, including system event monitoring, user management, file backups, and network configuration. Streamlined operations with scripts for event log reporting, bulk user handling, scheduled backups, and IP/network setup to boost efficiency in virtualized environments.
    
- https://github.com/matheusado/wireshark-traffic-analysis-and-filtering
- Demonstrated detailed packet-level analysis using Wireshark on a Kali Linux virtual machine, from capturing Ethernet traffic to applying advanced display filters for HTTPS and IP-specific data. Strengthened understanding of network protocols and gained hands-on experience in real-time traffic inspection and threat analysis.

- https://github.com/matheusadusa/DHCP-Network-Cisco-Visual-Guide
- A hands-on project demonstrating how to configure a DHCP network in Cisco Packet Tracer, including router setup, dynamic IP assignment, and network connectivity testing.

- https://github.com/matheusado/Router-Configuration-for-multiple-networks
- Set up a single Cisco router to manage multiple subnets within Cisco Packet Tracer, configuring interface IPs, subnet masks, and routing to enable seamless communication between networks. Includes step-by-step visual walkthroughs and testing to validate inter-network connectivity.
 
- https://github.com/matheusadusa/Linux-User-Group-Based-Script-Access
- A Linux project showcasing secure script execution using group-based permissions and shell scripting, focusing on access control through user/group management and tools like chmod and chgrp.

- https://github.com/matheusadusa/Packet-Tracer-Network-Setup-Star-Ring-Vlan-project
- A hands-on networking project using Cisco Packet Tracer to configure and analyze star and ring topologies with VLAN segmentation, focusing on real-world data flow, device setup, and connectivity testing.
